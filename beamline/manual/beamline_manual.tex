\section{What to Monitor along the Beamline}


\subsection{Beam conditions}
\indent

During data taking it is important to monitor the electron beam
to insure that changes in beam parameters do not effect data quality. For
example, changes in the beam halo can dramatically increase background rates
making the data worthless, or a change in the electron beam direction can cause
unwanted beam losses leading detector damage or beam trip. There are
automatic controls and alarms on beam conditions that will prevent beam damage to equipment 
and will terminate beam delivery in an event of beam excursion. Nevertheless,  the shift taker must
continuously monitor the beam parameters and act accordingly.

After the initial beam tuneup reference numbers for the beam parameters and the scalers will be posted
in the log book and on the run wiki page, and are to be used as reference. 

\subsubsection{Beam Current}
\indent

A consistent reading between the Faraday Cup (see Section \ref{sec:fcup}) current
and the "nA" BPMs is one way
to check that the electron beam is cleanly transported to the beam dump (Faraday Cup). {\bf Note:} in some experiments, when beam current exceeds allowed 
limit for Faraday cup, $\sim 150$ W power limit (Power in W = Current in nA x Energy in GeV), beam blocker will be inserted in front of the Faraday cup. Even with blocker on beam, Faraday cup reading will be proportional to the beam current. The coefficient of the proportionality is beam energy dependent and will be measured at each given energy setting. With blocker in-beam, the ratio of the currents read by Faraday cup and BPMs must be constant. In all cases one should observe the same current on all three nA BPMs (2C21, 2C24, and 2H01). In addition to the inconsistency of beam current readings, the halo counters (see Section \ref{sec:scaler_a}) should
show an increased activity if the beam is scraping the beam pipe. Also higher then normal rates in the detectors would be indicative
of scraping immediately downstream of the target.

In the event that there appears to be unacceptable beam losses the following course of action is recommended:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Stop taking data, and make an E-log entry flagging any data runs that may be
contaminated.
\item Call MCC and explain to the operator what has been observed and explain why
the tune is unacceptable.
\item Work with the MCC operator to come up with a game plan to fix the problem.
\item Document the solution and start taking data again.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Beam Halo}
\indent

The presence of a beam halo is usually observed by an increase count rate in
the beam halo counters (see Section \ref{sec:scaler_a}). Typically
the upstream counters are very quiet and any count rate above $\sim 200$Hz (after initial gain adjustments for a well tuned beam) is indicative
of a problem. Note that an increase count rate in the upstream beam halo counters
can also indicate an obstruction in the beam pipe or just a bad beam tune. To 
further investigate the source of a large count rate in the upstream beam halo
counters a harp scan (see the "electron beam profile scan" procedure in Section \ref{sec:harp}) should be performed. 

If the beam halo is unacceptable, take the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Stop taking data, make an E-log entry.
\item Call MCC and explain to the operator what has been observed and why this tune
is unacceptable.
\item Work with MCC to solve the problem.
\item Document the solution and start taking data again.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Beam Position}
\indent

The beam position before CLAS12 is available from three "nA" cavities, 2C21, 2C24, and 2H01, and one stripline BPM, 2H00 (when the beam current is above $25$ nA). The beam position monitors close to the target (2H00 and 2H01) are the most important ones to keep the beam position steady on the target. The Feedback system (the orbit lock) uses positions (XY) on these BPMs and the Horizontal and Vertical correctors on 2C22/2C23/2H00 girders to keep the beam position stable. Drifts more the \( \pm 0.1 \)mm
should be brought to the attention of MCC. The nA BPMs measure the beam position as well as the current. Before data taking, shift worker must confirm that the feedback system is active (verify with MCC). Note, that at beam currents below $25$ nA only "nA" cavities are reliable. 

\subsection{Beamline Vacuum}
\indent

The beamline vacuum is monitored from the vacuum screen available from the MCC (JTABs). The readings of the relevant vacuum gauges are also displayed on the Main Scaler GUI (see below). The vacuum tends to be of order \( 10^{-6} \) torr upstream of the tagger magnet (upstream tunnel), and of order \( 10^{-5} \) torr
near the tagger and throughout the downstream beam line. Vacuum is tightly monitored and interlocked to the beam delivery. 


\subsubsection{Catastrophic Loss of Vacuum}
\indent

There are two thin windows that are components of the CLAS beamline, the target scattering chamber exit window
and the entrance window to the downstream beamline (after the target). If either of these two windows fail under vacuum
load there are fast valves interlocked to pressure gauges which will close
automatically. These valves will limit the loss of vacuum to the small region  of the Hall B beamline. Valves are interlocked to the beam Fast Shutdown System (FSD) and beam will be shutoff in an event of vacuum loss.

If any of the valves close due to poor vacuum: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item notify MCC immediately, turn off the beam (if it is not already OFF)
\item call the engineering on call 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Magnet Power Supplies}
\indent

The Hall-B beamline and CLAS have magnets for beam transport, and momentum analysis. In Table \ref{magnets} list of the magnets, their power supplies
and point of control (POC) are shown. The items listed with B
as the point of control will be controlled by staff in the counting
house. The vertical and horizontal correctors, and the tagger magnet are controlled
by MCC, but the shift taker should monitor their settings. The tagger
magnet power supply is interlocked to the machine Fast Shutdown System (FSD). Interlocks are activated if run requires dumping the beam in the tagger beam dump, e,g during the initial beam tune or during the beam polarization measurements using the Moller polarimeter. When the tagger
trips off, the beam will be automatically shut off. This interlock must 
be masked out when electron beam is delivered to the CLAS target, and to electron dump (Faraday cup) through the hall. 

The CLAS12 solenoid and torus power supplies are also interlocked to machine Fast Shutdown System and must be activated (unmasked) when  electron beam is delivered to the CLAS target, and to electron dump (Faraday cup).

\caption{List of the magnets along the Hall B beamline and their functionality.\label{magnets}}
\end{table} 

If the tagger or any of CLAS12 superconducting magnets do trip off or is set incorrectly take the following action:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Call MCC immediately, tell them to shut off the beam. Call Hall-B engineering on-call if torus or solenoid triped.
\item Make an E-log entry.
\item Restore magnets 
\begin{itemize}
\item have MCC restore the tagger dipole 
\item call engineering on-call to restore CLAS12 superconducting magnets (torus or solenoid)
\end{itemize}
\item Restore beam, (if beam was going to Faraday cup, verify that the beam is incident on the downstream viewer)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Magnet and Power Supply Beacons}
\indent

Near every magnet in Hall B there is a \textcolor{red}{red flashing beacon} that indicates status of the magnets. If beacon is
flashing then the magnet \textbf{\textcolor{black}{is powered}} or \textbf{\textcolor{black}{can be powered}} at
any time. If you need to work near or on a magnet and the red light is flashing
you must turn off the supply. The dangers of working
near a magnet are limited to those associated with stray magnetic fields. All
the high current bus work is enclosed in protective shields so there is no shock
hazard. Of course the supply needs to be shut off and lock and tagged before
any of the protective shield is removed.

After any work that required the power supply to be lock and tagged a through
sweep of the magnet area for magnetic debris is required before the lock and
tag can be removed.


\section{Hall B Epics Control Screens}

All the GUIs necessary to run the beam and the CLAS12 detector can be launched from CS Studio EPICS interface. 

\subsection{EPICS GUI Launcher}
\indent

The \emph{"clascss"} (see Fig.\ref{clascss}) is a \emph{css studio} screen that serves as an icon manager of
\emph{css} screens. From this screen, the bulk of the epics applications can
be started. It is recommended that when finished with a particular \emph{css}
screen, that application be terminated (\textbf{not iconized}). If the screen
is needed in the future, just launch it again from the \emph{"clascss"}. In this
manner searching through all the degenerate icons is eliminated. 

To start the \emph{"clascss"}:

\begin{itemize}
\item log on one of  \textbf{clon} PCs or \textbf{clonsl(1,2,3)} computers as clasrun
\item type: \textbf{clascss}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htp]
{\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.85]{CLAS_CSS.pdf}\par}
\caption{\small{CLAS12 EPICS GUI launcher.}}
\label{clascss}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Main Control and Monitoring Screen}
\indent

The most relevant information for running the beam in a safe and efficient manner is displayed and can be controlled from the Main Control and Monitoring GUI, see Figure \ref{fig:scaler}. This screen can be launch from CS-studio interface using "Beamline" button from the menu. The main control screen should be up on a single display on one PCs in the counting room and must be monitored by shift personnel at all times. 

The GUI consists of several rows of information. On the top row rates in the beam halo counters and in the CLAS12 detector elements are displayed. The second row displays information on the beam position (BPM, BOM) and current (BPM, SLM, Faraday cup) monitors. The middle row has all moving devices, harps, the collimator, beam viewer, and beam blocker. The control GUIs for these devices can be launched from this main GUI. In row four, vacuum gauges (cold cathode gauges) are displayed. The bottom row shows magnet settings, including correctors, quadrupoles, the tagger dipole and the CLAS12 solenoid and torus.   


\begin{figure}[tbhp]
{\centering \resizebox*{0.75\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics[angle=90]{main_scaler_gui.pdf}} \par}
\caption{The main scaler GUI.}
 \label{fig:scaler}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Beam Halo Counters (classc1/classc4) \label{sec:scaler_a}}
\indent

The beam halo counters consist of photomultiplier tubes with plastic attached to their photocathodes strapped to the beam pipes along the beamline. There are two halo counters 
upstream of the Hall-B tagger magnet, four counters upstream of the CLAS target, and four counters located in the apex of the forward carriage. The beam halo counter scalers are displayed on the Main GUI, top line. 

The rate in halo counters is a good indicator of the beam transport quality. After initial beam tune and calibration, rates for good beam conditions will be recorded in the logbook and on the run wiki, and should be closely monitored. 

\subsubsection{Beam Offset Monitor}
\indent

In addition to the halo counters, when cryo target is used, there is a beam offset monitor (BOM) mounted at the entrance of the target cell, centered on the entrance window of the target cell. The BOM consist of a glass-silica cylinder ($10$ mm ID) with $16$ plastic fibers attached to the upstream perimeter. Fibers are uniformly distributed along the perimeter of the cylinder and read out by multi-anode (16) PMT. 

The main function of the BOM is to alert on beam motion at the target. If beam moves from the target center it will generate high rates in BOM PMT due to interaction of the beam tails with cylinder. 


\subsection{nA BPM Displays}
\indent

The readout of na BPMs are displayed on the main scaler GUI as well as on BPM GUI, Fig. \ref{fig:bpm}. The BPM screen can be launched
via the \emph{"clascss"} by selecting the \textbf{Beam}
pull down menu.
\begin{figure}[tbhp]
{\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{bpms.pdf} \par}
\caption{The Hall B current screen. The current reading, in nAmps. The Faraday Cup current
reading is updated at the same rate as the beam halo scalers. \label{fig:bpm}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Hall-B Harps (classc3/classc4)\label{sec:harp}}
\indent

There are three wire harps on the Hall B beamline, 2C21, "tagger" (2C24), and 2H01A. The 2C21 harp has two $25~\mu$m tungsten wires that cross the beam in horizontal (X) and vertical (Y)directions. The "tagger" and 2H01A harps have two sets of wires, thin and thick. There are three thin $25~\mu$m tungsten wires, which cross the beam in X, Y, and $45^\circ$ axis, and two thick $1$ mm iron wires in X and Y directions. The harp launch GUI, {\it Harp Scans} shown in Figure \ref{harpmain}, enables operator to open controls for the desired harp. A stepper motor in conjunction
with the beam halo scalers is used to perform a beam profile measurements. The harp operation is controlled from the {\it Harp Scans} GUI (controls for 2C21 harp are shown on the figure). During a scan the beam halo scaler GUI is controlled by the scan application,  (see Section \ref{sec:scaler_a}).

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
{\centering \resizebox*{0.75\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{harps.pdf}} \par}
\caption{The main Harp medm screen. The green buttons on the top are for opening individual harp control. Cyan buttons below for expert GUIs.}
\label{harpmain}
\end{figure}

In order to perform a harp scan one should push {\it SCAN} button. After the scan finished (motor position has been restored at $0.0$ position) use {\it Analyze} to see beam profile and fit results to the scaler distributions. Make sure beam is stable during the scan. If beam has been lost during the scan, information (halo counter rates) from wire crossing the beam will be lost. In this case beam scan must be repeated.  


\subsection{Collimator \label{sec:colim}}
\indent

In order to prevent direct beam exposure of the SVT or forward MM tracker from possible beam excursions a collimator will be installed $\sim 15$ meters upstream of the detectors. This is the same collimator box and a $20$ cm long Nickel collimators used in the past for the tagged photon beams in Hall B. One of collimators is resized to have $20$ mm diameter hole. The collimator control GUI will have sizes and motor positions for each collimator in the box, see Figure \ref{fig:beamblocker}. In order to position required collimator open the {\it Motors} GUI, select {\it Hall-B Colli} tab and click on the collimator button you want to move.   

\subsection{Beam Viewer \label{sec:view}}
\indent

There is a beam viewer installed in the downstream tunnel, right before the shielding wall that separates Faraday cup dump. The viewer is a wheel with three screens mounted: a Chromox disk, a Yag crystal, and a $4~\mu$m thick polished aluminum foil as OTR viewer. The motor that control the position of screens can be controlled from the same {\it Motors} GUI as collimator, see Figure \ref{fig:beamblocker}. In order to position required screen just push the button carrying the name of the screen.  

\subsection{Faraday Cup (classc4) \label{sec:fcup}}
\indent

The instantaneous beam current reading from the Faraday cup is available on
the \textbf{Main Scaler} screen as shown in Figure \ref{fig:scaler}. The update rate is the same as for the beam halo scalers and
is controlled from the scaler GUI, see Section \ref{sec:scaler_a}. An important consideration
is that the Faraday Cup current integrater rate is 10 counts/sec when the current
is 1 nA. This means that if the count time on the scaler is less than 1 sec
you will observe large statistical fluctuations.


\subsubsection{Beam blocker}
\indent

The Hall-B Faraday cup is not cooled and cannot operate at high currents (deposited hit should not exceed 150W for more than 1/2 hour running). If run requires use of beam currents above the limit (for 11 GeV it is 15 nA), beam blocker, cooled-copper absorber, must be position in front of the Faraday cup. The beam blocker can be controlled from {\it Motors} GUI shown in Figure \ref{fig:beamblocker}.  From {\it Motors} GUI select {\it Blocker} then push {\it Go beam} button  in order to put the blocker on the beam and {\it Go Home} to retract if from the beamline. 

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
{\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{collimator.pdf} \par}
\caption{The beam GUI to operate collimator and beam blocker. \label{fig:beamblocker}}
\end{figure}


\clearpage

\subsection{\bf Target}
\indent

The Hall-B sryo target used in the past, in $6$ GeV era, will be used for the CLAS12. The main differences are larger diameter target cell and the longer supply pipes from condenser to the target. In anticipation of larger beam sizes at high energies ($> 3$ pass), target cell diameter is designed to be $20$ mm and the thin portion of the cell windows ($20~\mu$m thick aluminum) $10$ mm in diameter. Figure \ref{target} shows design rendering of the CLAS cryo target inside the foam scattering chamber. Control of the target, filling and emptying, will be done using {\it Target PC}. Operator should follow special instructions for the target operations. For monitoring, the target temperature, pressure, and the buffer dewar liquid level are displayed on the Main Control and Monitoring GUI, Figure \ref{fig:scaler}. 

The solid target for the commissioning runs will be a $500 ~\mu$m-thick carbon wire mounted on the 2H01A harp stick. The harp control will be used to insert or retracted the target.
