\title{Beam parameters for the Hall-B RG-M run during November 2021 through January 2022}
\author{}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

Hall-B Run Group M is scheduled to run from November 10, 2021, to January 31, 2022. in experimental Hall B. The CLAS12 is a multipurpose detector system based on a toroidal (forward detector) and a solenoid (central  detector) superconducting magnets. The detector system includes Cherenkov Counters, Drift Chambers, Scintillator Counters, Silicon-strip detectors, Micro-mega gas detectors, and Calorimeters. In this run period CLAS12 will be used in its standard detector and shielding configuration with the Forward tagger off and the Large Moller cone installed. RG-M run will use up to 6 GeV (3 passes) electron beam, with currents up to 300 nA (up to 500 nA on empty target). This run will use several different targets ranging from cryogenic, liquid targets, to heavy solid targets. Targets will be located inside the vacuum scattering chamber that is installed inside the central detector in the center of the 5 T solenoid magnet.

The target system used for RG-M is the Saclay cryo-target.  This target system has been used in Hall B throughout the 6 GeV and 12 GeV era. RG-M will use the following liquid targets using the Saclay cryo target system (H$_2$, D$_2$, ${}^{4}$He, Ar), and also solid targets (${}^{120}$Sn, C). This target system will be able to support all the targets of interest, except for ${}^{40,48}$Ca which will require encapsulation and will need to be mounted separately. The targets are housed in a vacuum vessel along with the cryogenic system.  A scattering chamber is installed around the target cell area.  This is made from Rohacell foam with a wall thickness of 6.5 mm.  Aluminum windows are used at the entrance and exit of the liquid cells, and at the exit of the scattering chamber.

The details of all components, such as windows and cells, are shown on the beam line drawing, including thicknesses and locations.  The beam line layout is shown in Figure \ref{fig:beamline}


Thwe requirements for beam parameters for RG-M runare summarized in Table~\ref{tab:beam_par}

For initial beamline tuning and after extended down time (>8 hours) the electron bem will be dumped in the tagger dump. After that the beam will be sent to the Faraday Cup and centered on the target.  For beam currents for which beam power exceeds 175 W on the Faraday Cup (30 nA at 6 GeV, 44 nA at 4 GeV and 87 nA at 2 GeV) the beam blocker will be inserted upstream of the Faraday Cup.

Table~\ref{tab:run_plan} presents the proposed run plan. Depending on the performance of the experiment and accelerator it will be adjusted.
